## Tools for Recording

### For Screenshots:
- **Windows**: Snipping Tool, Snagit, or Windows + Shift + S
- **Free alternative**: Greenshot
- **Professional**: Snagit, Camtasia

### For Video Recording:
- **Free**: OBS Studio (recommended)
- **Windows built-in**: Xbox Game Bar (Windows + G)
- **Professional**: Camtasia, Bandicam

### For Documentation:
- **Microsoft Word** for professional documents
- **Markdown** for technical documentation
- **PDF** for final submission

## Recording Tips

### For Screenshots:
1. Use consistent resolution (1920x1080 recommended)
2. Capture full browser windows
3. Include URLs in browser address bar
4. Highlight important elements with arrows/boxes
5. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., "01_Jira_Project_Created.png")

### For Videos:
1. Record in 1080p resolution
2. Use clear, steady screen recording
3. Include audio narration explaining steps
4. Keep videos focused (5-15 minutes each)
5. Show successful completion of each step

### For Documentation:
1. Use clear, numbered steps
2. Include timestamps for when tasks were completed
3. Reference specific screenshots and videos
4. Include team member contributions
5. Document any issues and how they were resolved

## Quality Checklist

Before submission, verify:
- [ ] All screenshots are clear and readable
- [ ] All videos play properly and have audio
- [ ] Documentation is complete and well-formatted
- [ ] All team members are properly credited
- [ ] All required steps are documented
- [ ] Integration between tools is clearly demonstrated

## Timeline Suggestion

### Day 1-2: Setup and Initial Configuration
- Complete Jira and GitHub setup
- Install and configure Jenkins
- Record setup videos

### Day 3-4: Pipeline Development and Testing
- Create and test Jenkins pipeline
- Integrate JMeter testing
- Record pipeline execution videos

### Day 5-6: Docker Integration and Team Testing
- Complete Docker workflow
- Have team members test the process
- Record collaboration videos

### Day 7: Documentation and Submission
- Compile all documentation
- Organize screenshots and videos
- Create final submission package

Remember: Start early and document as you go! It's much easier to record while you're doing the work than to recreate it later.
